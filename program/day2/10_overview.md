**Note**: This overview has been adapted from the overview document "CORE Skills - Data Science Springboard - Prerequisite Summary", authored by Cara Kreck, Dr. Rebecca Lange and Dr. Kathryn Napier (Curtin University).

## Aim

Aim 1: Get over the initial 'inertia hump' of beginning your data science journey.
Aim 2: Be aware of what data science is and where the field has come from.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Open and use the tools.
2. Recognise and understand basic Python syntax.
3. Perform analysis by loading and using packages.
4. Can appraise data cleaning and analysis requirements of a data set.
5. Can conduct automation of workflows (e.g. writing functions and conditional statements).
