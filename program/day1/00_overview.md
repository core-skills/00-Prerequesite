**Note**: This overview has been adapted from the overview document "CORE Skills - Data Science Springboard - Prerequisite Summary", authored by Cara Kreck, Dr. Rebecca Lange and Dr. Kathryn Napier (Curtin University).

## Aim

Aim 1: Introduce the structure and tools of the 15 day Professionals Program.
Aim 2: Clarify participant expectations and desired outcomes of the program.
Aim 3: Ensure participants have local access to software, and develop a shared skill base and technical familiarity ready for program kick-off.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Define the **WHY**, the **WHAT** and the **HOW** of the 15 day Data Science Springboard.
2. Explain the need for version control.
3. Explain how to track files on own computer using Git.
4. Demonstrate how to use tools for collaborative projects (e.g. using remote repositories).
