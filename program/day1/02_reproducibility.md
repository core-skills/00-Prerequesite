# Reproducibility

More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's
experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those
are some of the telling figures that emerged from Nature's survey of 1,576 researchers
who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research<sup><a id="a4">[4](#f4)</a></sup>.
Another way to think about this is in terms of the risk associated with key personnel leaving
a project, this also known as the bus factor<sup><a id="a5">[5](#f5)</a></sup>.
Reproducibility considers aspects important to either re-producing or continuing work on a
project, including:

1. Documentation

  * This is the idea of documenting your procedures and workflows for your
    project so that an outsider could understand the workings of your team.
  * This also includes documenting your code so you or someone else can
    continue working on it in the future.
  * "Documentation is a love letter to your future self" - Damian Conway

2. Naming Conventions

  * Having standard naming conventions makes it easier to know how to name
    files and recognise what they are about at a glimpse.
  * It makes it harder to lose files as you know what you are looking for
    in the first place.
  * It makes processing the files easier as this task can be automated efficiently.

3. Version control

  * This allows you to record and manage changes made to files and folders.
  * A version control system like Git also keeps track of useful metadata such as
    who made the change and when, and what was the change about.

is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being
shared among team members, derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a
bus." [↩](#a5)
